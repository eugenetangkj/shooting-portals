This is for some developers who like to make run and shoot game.

No growing effect FX on the hero. Because it will restrict the shooting speed. 

For example, how many bullet he shoots per walk cycle? If i did one grow effect it will 
shoot one bullet on the growing effect frame per walk cycle. If i paint 2 growing effect frame per walk cycle
means 2 bullets per walk cycle. 

This is an extra animation by the way. Happy developing games!!!
