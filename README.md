# Shooting Portals
Shooting Portals is a 2D puzzle-based platformer for PC. It is developed using Unity and Playfab. There are a total of 10 levels. You can play the game [here](https://play.unity.com/mg/other/webgl-builds-200053) and a walkthrough can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/15xZOpnZ_foW7wAA9tumequzBluv4j2aj?usp=sharing)

The game revolves around the main character Pulse, who is a researcher and inventor of portal technology. He invented the Portal Gate, which allows one to travel to different galaxies. However, his dog, Orbit, accidentally ran into the Portal Gate. Pulse thus sets off on his adventure to rescue Orbit.

## Features
### 1. Login system

One can select and play the desired level using the Level Selection interface.

### 3. Loading Screens
Loading screens are presented when players transition from one scene to another.

### 4. Player Mechanics
Player mechanics available in Shooting Portals include basic movement and portal-based abilities.

#### Explanation for portal-based abilities

Pulse can shoot a portal bullet using his portal gun. If the portal bullet hits terrain, it spawns a portal. Pulse can have a maximum of 2 portals, where spawning a third one would destroy the first portal. When there is 1 portal, there is no special effect. When there are 2 portals, Pulse can teleport from one portal to another.

### 5. Pause Menu
Players can pause the game and bring up the pause menu when playing in any level. Features in the pause menu include resume game, restart level, customise key bindings and quit level.

### 6. In-game Portal Count UI
At the top left of the screen, there will be a count that indicates the number of existing portals that the player has.

### 7. Checkpoint-based Respawn System
In Shooting Portals, the player has only 1 life. However, there are checkpoints in every room (excluding boss levels). Hence, if the player dies in a room, he will respawn in the current room, allowing him to try again.

### 8. Tutorial Prompts
In Levels 1 and 2, there are tutorial prompts that utilise both text and graphics to explain to new players how to play the game.

### 9. Cutscenes
We included cutscenes that utilised animations and dialogue boxes to advance the storyline through the game.
